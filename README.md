# Node.js DOM performance benchmarks

⚠️ **This is a cheap test!** My usecase was parsing a unique document once, and running a query selector once. This is very different from parsing a document once, and running many, many queries on it.

### Methodology

1. Parse a long document (the GitHub.com homepage, © GitHub)
2. Query for a specific element, using whatever the parser has available
3. Repeat 999×

### Results

\*I know what you’re thinking—“why is WASM slower?” Like I said, my methodology here was **parsing a document 1,000×.** WASM has a very expensive startup cost that JS doesn’t. I’m sure that once it’s loaded, it would run circles around everything else. So take these benchmarks with a grain of salt if you’re reusing the same document and not throwing it away each time like I was doing.

\*\* jsdom ran out of memory after taking at least 30 seconds. I didn’t get to benchmark it, but that told me all I needed to know (dunno what run it was on either).
